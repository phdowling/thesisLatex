	abstract = {Background
Endovascular procedure volume has increased rapidly, and endovascular procedures have become the initial treatment option for many vascular diseases. Consequently, training in endovascular procedures has become an essential component of vascular surgery training. We hypothesized that, due to this paradigm shift, open surgical case volume may have declined, thereby jeopardizing training and technical skill acquisition in open procedures.
Methods
Vascular surgery trainees are required to log both open and endovascular procedures with the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education ({ACGME}). We analyzed the {ACGME} database (2001-2007), which records all cases (by Current Procedural Terminology [{CPT}] code) performed by graduating vascular trainees. Case volume was evaluated according to the mean number of cases performed per graduating trainee.
Results
The mean number of total major vascular procedures performed per trainee increased by 174\% between 2001 and 2007 (from 298.3 to 519.2). Endovascular diagnostic and therapeutic procedures increased by 422\% (from 63.7 to 269.1) and accounted for 93.0\% of the increase in total procedures. The number of open aortic procedures (aneurysm, occlusive, mesenteric, renal) decreased by 17.1\% (from 49.7 to 41.2), while the number of endovascular aortic aneurysm repair procedures increased by 298.8\% (from 16.9 to 50.5). Specifically, open aortic aneurysm procedures decreased by 21.8\%, aortobifemoral bypass increased by 3.2\%, and open mesenteric or renal procedures decreased by 13\%. Infrainguinal bypass procedures remained relatively constant (from 37.6 to 36.5, 2.9\% decrease), and the number of carotid endarterectomy procedures performed did not change significantly (from 43.6 to 42.2, 3.2\% decrease).
Conclusion
Vascular surgery trainees are performing a vastly increased total number of procedures. This increase in total procedure volume is almost entirely attributable to the recent increase in endovascular procedures. Aside from a small decline in open aortic procedures, the volume of open surgical procedures has largely remained stable. It is essential that vascular surgery training programs continue to focus on both endovascular and open surgical skills in order for vascular surgeons to remain the premier specialists to care for patients with vascular disease.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: Simulator-based endovascular skills training measurably improves performance in catheter-based image-guided interventions. The purpose of this study was to determine whether structured global performance assessment during endovascular simulation correlated well with trainee-reported procedural skill and prior experience level.
{METHODS}: Fourth-year and fifth-year general surgery residents interviewing for vascular fellowship training provided detailed information regarding prior open vascular and endovascular operative experience. The pretest questionnaire responses were used to separate subjects into low ({\textless}20 cases) and moderate (20 to 100) endovascular experience groups. Subjects were then asked to perform a renal angioplasty/stent procedure on the Procedicus Vascular Intervention System Trainer ({VIST}) endovascular simulator (Mentice Corporation, Gothenburg, Sweden). The subjects' performance was supervised and evaluated by a blinded expert interventionalist using a structured global assessment scale based on angiography setup, target vessel catheterization, and the interventional procedure. Objective measures determined by the simulator were also collected for each subject. A postsimulation questionnaire was administered to determine the subjects' self-assessment of their performance.
{RESULTS}: Seventeen surgical residents from 15 training programs completed questionnaires before and after the exercise and performed a renal angioplasty/stent procedure on the endovascular simulator. The beginner group (n = 8) reported prior experience of a median of eight endovascular cases (interquartile range [{IQR}], 6.5-17.8; range, 4-20), and intermediate group (n = 9) had previously completed a median of 42 cases ({IQR}, 31-44; range, 25-89, P = .01). The two groups had similar prior open vascular experience (79 cases vs 75, P = .60). The mean score on the structured global assessment scale for the low experience group was 2.68 of 5.0 possible compared with 3.60 for the intermediate group (P = .03). Scores for subcategories of the global assessment score for target vessel catheterization (P = .02) and the interventional procedure (P = .05) contributed more to the differentiation between the two experience groups. Total procedure time, fluoroscopy time, average contrast used, percentage of lesion covered by the stent, placement accuracy, residual stenosis rates, and number of cine loops utilized were similar between the two groups (P {\textgreater} .05).
{CONCLUSION}: Structured endovascular skills assessment correlates well with prior procedural experience within a high-fidelity simulation environment. In addition to improving endovascular training, simulators may prove useful in determining procedural competency and credentialing standards for endovascular surgeons.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: Endovascular techniques are an integral part of modern-day vascular surgery practice and training. Nevertheless, validated in vitro assessment tools for these skills are scarce. This study describes the development and pilot testing of the Simulator for Testing and Rating Endovascular Skills ({STRESS} machine).
{DESIGN}: The design was kept straightforward and compact, without the need for contrast or fluoroscopy. A specific technical skill score was designed analogous to the Imperial College Evaluation of Procedural Skill ({ICEPS}), an assessment score for open surgical skill. This score was combined with an already validated global rating assessment to form the total score ({TS}).
{METHODS}: A pilot study was carried out on 18 candidates of varying levels of expertise: novice, intermediate and expert, who were assessed by two independent observers to test inter-observer reliability.
{RESULTS}: Inter-observer reliability was excellent, Cronbach's alpha coefficient of the {TS} was 0.94 (95\% confidence interval: 0.84-0.97). A one-way analysis of variance ({ANOVA}) showed a significant difference between the novice and expert groups (p{\textless}0.001), between the novice and intermediate groups (p{\textless}0.01) and between the intermediate and expert groups (p{\textless}0.05).
{CONCLUSION}: The {STRESS} machine, in combination with the specific technical skill score and global rating assessment, provides a reliable method of discriminating between the novice, intermediate and expert candidates with excellent inter-observer variability.},

	abstract = {{AIMS}: Adjuncts to conventional surgical training are needed in order to address the reduction in working hours. This purpose of this study was to objectively assess the efficacy of workshop training on simulators.
{METHODS}: Fifteen consecutive participants of the European Vascular Workshop in 2003 and 2004 were recruited to this study. Participants performed a proximal anastomosis on a commercially available abdominal aortic aneurysm simulator, were then given intensive training on sophisticated models for 3 days and re-assessed. Pre- and post-course procedures were videotaped and independently reviewed by three assessors (tapes were blinded and in random order). The operative end product was similarly assessed. Four measures of technical skill were used: generic skill, procedural skill; a five point technical rating of the anastomosis (assessed using validated rating scales) and procedure time. Non-parametric tests were used in the statistical analysis.
{RESULTS}: The video assessment scores for aneurysm repair increased significantly following completion of the course (p=0.006 and p=0.004 for generic and procedural skill, respectively). End product assessment scores increased significantly post-course (p=0.001) and participants performed aneurysm repair faster following the course (p{\textless}0.05). Inter-observer reliability ranged from alpha=0.84-0.98 for the three rating scales pre- and post-course.
{CONCLUSION}: Objective improvements in technical performance follow intensive workshop training. Participants' perform better, faster, and with an improved end product following the course. Such adjuncts to training play an important part in a focused integrated programme that addresses reduced work hours.},

	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}: Reduced work hours and concerns over patient safety have encouraged surgical educators to find methods to advance resident skills more efficiently. Simulation provides the opportunity to improve technical surgical skills outside the operating room. We hypothesized that practice on surgical task simulators would improve residents' technical performance of vascular anastomotic technique.
{METHODS}: Senior general surgery residents at an academic medical center completed pretests and posttests on 3 vascular surgery simulators: femoral-popliteal bypass, carotid endarterectomy, and abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. The initial training sessions began with a 15-minute instructional video on how to perform the procedures, followed by supervised sessions in anastomotic technique with attending vascular surgeons. Initial individual sessions were videotaped as a pretest, and the final attempt was videotaped as the posttest. Each test was evaluated by a single experienced attending vascular surgeon blinded to the examinees. Anastomoses were graded using a performance rating and a modified objective structured assessment of technical skill rating. Results were analyzed using mixed model P values.
{RESULTS}: The residents showed statistically significant improvement between the pretest and the posttest in both their performance rating (1.9 vs. 2.4, P = 0.02) and the objective structured assessment of technical skill (2.6 vs. 3.1, P = 0.01), as well as in most subsets of each assessment scale.
{CONCLUSIONS}: We conclude that practice using simulated anastomotic models leads to measurable improvement in vascular anastomotic technique in senior general surgery residents.},

	abstract = {Simulation technology has a well-defined role in nonmedical professions such as aviation and over the last two decades has permeated medical training. The most successful surgical simulation is in the fields of laparoscopic and endovascular surgery. These two-dimensional scenarios, as in the aviation industry, lend themselves to simulation. Open simulators have been met with more resistance than their laparoscopic counterparts because of the difficulties in simulating the three-dimensional field. Engaging in persistent practice is what makes the expert and all trainees should aspire to this. Without knowing, all surgical trainees have engaged in deliberate practice when first learning to tie surgical knots. This deliberate practice should be used in all aspects of vascular surgical practice, and it is no longer acceptable to perform procedures such as arterial anastomoses for the first time on patients. Simulators exist for all aspects of vascular surgical training and vary in complexity and price. Some of these simulators are suitable for use at home or in a skills laboratory whereas others are more suitable for use in a specialized skills center. Training on these simulators can be offered at a local level or at a regional level in the skills center. Where surgical procedures are not commonly performed or expertise is required for a new innovation, it is more appropriate to have national or internationally based workshops under the auspices of surgical boards or societies. Simulation of crisis management, well known in aviation, has also been applied to vascular surgical practice and can offer benefit to senior trainees even when their performance on a noncrisis simulator has reached a plateau. This article identifies the areas where simulation in open vascular surgery can benefit the trainee.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.ejvs.2006.12.022},
	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}: There is a learning curve in the acquisition of endovascular skills for the treatment of vascular disease. Integration of Virtual reality ({VR}) simulator based training into the educational training curriculum offers a potential solution to overcome this learning curve. However evidence-based training curricula that define which tasks, how often and in which order they should be performed have yet to be developed. The aim of this study was to determine the nature of skills acquisition on the renal and iliac modules of a commercially-available {VR} simulator.
{METHOD}: 20 surgical trainees without endovascular experience were randomised to complete eight sessions on a {VR} iliac (group A) or renal (group B) training module. To determine skills transferability across the two procedures, all subjects performed two further {VR} cases of the other procedure. Performance was recorded by the simulator for parameters such as time taken, contrast fluid usage and stent placement accuracy.
{RESULTS}: During training, both groups demonstrated statistically significant {VR} learning curves: group A for procedure time (p{\textless}0.001) and stent placement accuracy (p=0.013) group B for procedure time (p{\textless}0.001), fluoroscopy time (p=0.003) and volume of contrast fluid used (p{\textless}0.001). At crossover, subjects in group B (renal trained) performed to the same level of skill on the simulated iliac task as group A. However, those in group A (iliac trained) had a significantly higher fluoroscopy time (median 118 vs 72 secs, p=0.020) when performing their first simulated renal task than for group B.
{CONCLUSION}: Novice endovascular surgeons can significantly improve their performance of simulated procedures through repeated practice on {VR} simulators. Skills transfer between tasks was demonstrated but complex task training, such as selective arterial cannulation in simulators and possibly in the real world appears to involve a separate skill. It is thus suggested that a stepwise and hierarchical training curriculum is developed for acquisition of endovascular skill using {VR} simulation to supplement training on patients.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: The primary goal of this study was to determine whether exposure to endovascular simulator training increases interest in vascular surgery among medical students. Secondary goals were to determine whether interest in vascular surgery is inversely related to the time after exposure, to identify factors associated with interest, and to identify students' characteristics that positively influence performance metrics.
{METHODS}: This was a prospective, randomized, crossover study comprising 80 medical students who were randomized into group A (n = 40) and group B (n = 40). Participants completed a survey of their interest in vascular surgery and attitudinal factors using Vascular Surgery Interest Form ({VSIF}) before exposure to the simulator (pretest). At 1 month after exposure of group A to the simulator, both groups were tested using {VSIF} (test). Upon completion of testing, group B was exposed to simulator training, whereas group A received no further training. At 2 months after exposure of group B to the simulator, both groups were posttested using {VSIF}, which asked the students' level of interest in vascular surgery using a 1 to 10 scale. Performance metrics were recorded during each exposure. Differences among cohort demographics were determined using Pearson χ(2) analysis. Differences in interest were determined with paired sample correlations. Linear regression and analysis of variance were used to correlate {VSIF} responses with interest and the performance metrics.
{RESULTS}: Both student cohorts had significant increases in interest after exposure to simulation. In group A, test interest (mean ± standard deviation) was significantly higher than pretest and posttest interests (5.51 ± 1.73 vs 4.00 ± 1.88 vs 4.18 ± 1.82; P {\textless} .05). In group B, posttest interest was significantly higher than pretest and test interests (5.62 ± 2.03 vs 3.96 ± 1.61 vs 4.08 ± 1.64; P {\textless} .05). The increase in interest was reciprocally related to the time passed since the initial exposure. Resident and attending lifestyle, length of training, radiation concerns, gender identification of a mentor, and personality fit with occupation were not correlated with interest. Sex, medical school year, comfort with endovascular procedures, willingness to work long hours, interest in performing percutaneous procedures, and commitment to surgical career did not affect impact performance metrics.
{CONCLUSIONS}: One exposure of students to endovascular simulator training is associated with an increase in vascular surgery interest. Acquired interest is reciprocally related to the time demonstrating the temporal importance of the exposure.},

Simulation is currently being used to increase training efficiency. It allows trainees to experience uncommon clinical situations and complications, repetitive practice opportunities, and can be done on a flexible schedule-all without risk to the patient. Additionally, feedback after a simulation can provide trainees with an assessment of their training progress. Many of the procedures and cases in cardiothoracic and vascular anesthesia can be simulated. Current devices can simulate bronchoscopy, vessel cannulation, complex case management, and cardiopulmonary bypass. They vary from the simple to the complex and from inexpensive homemade wooden devices to high-end computer-controlled virtual reality simulators.

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: Prior work has established that performance on an endovascular simulator incorporating tactile feedback (haptics) correlates with previous endovascular experience and can be improved by training. This study was designed to test the ability to define and measure innate endovascular aptitude and empirically correct performance and to determine whether these are two different things.
{METHODS}: Subjects ranging in endovascular skill level from novice to expert were surveyed to determine video game experience and skill, endovascular level of training, and endovascular experience. They were then tested by using a standard protocol requiring timed advancement of a catheter and wire sequentially into each of three vessels arising from a simulated type I arch. Recorded trials were independently and blindly scored by two experienced endovascular faculty members by using a modification of a previously validated scale (Modified Reznick Scale; {MRS}). Summed scores were analyzed by frequency analysis and categorized as satisfactory and unsatisfactory on the basis of a clear bimodal distribution. Categorical outcome, time to task completion, and other variables were analyzed by means of linear regression, analysis of variance, and Welch modified two-sample t tests, as indicated.
{RESULTS}: A total of 61 subjects were enrolled: 42\% students, 8\% technicians, 19\% surgeons, 13\% cardiologists, and 18\% radiologists. Of these, 62\% were considered novices and 30\% experts on the basis of previous experience; 56\% of subjects worked in an endovascular-related occupation. {MRS} scores were highly correlated between raters (P {\textless} .0001) and showed a clear bimodal distribution, with subjects in any endovascular occupation (including technicians) scoring significantly better than all others (P {\textless} .0001). Hours of video games played per week were correlated highly with completion times (P {\textless} .001) and {MRS} scores (P {\textless} .001). Measures of formal training (number of endovascular cases and occupation) correlated highly with completion times (all P {\textless} .03) and {MRS} scores (all P {\textless} .008). In comparing completion times vs {MRS} scores, three groups were apparent: unskilled-inexperienced, skilled-inexperienced, and skilled-experienced, corresponding primarily to senior subjects without endovascular experience, younger subjects without endovascular experience, and formally trained endovascular physicians, respectively. Those judged intermediate in aptitude reduced times to the lowest possible level before improving their {MRS} scores.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Although inherently subjective, the {MRS} yields reproducible scores that correlate with endovascular experience and formal training. Experts and novices with extensive video game experience achieve short completion times, whereas high {MRS} scores are achieved only by formally trained subjects. Innate endovascular aptitude and empirically correct performance may be two separate things, and aptitude may be acquirable through (or identified by) extensive nonmedical video game experience.},

{BACKGROUND}: Despite a paucity of data on the efficacy of simulation in medicine, cardiovascular simulation training is now a mandated part of cardiovascular fellowship training. Additionally, simulators have been endorsed by the Food and Drug Administration as a way to teach physicians new and novel procedures. We sought to establish the current use of simulators in cardiovascular medicine.
{METHODS}: A systematic review was done of available training programs, and currently existing data regarding simulation training. A panel of experts was convened to review this data and provide recommendations as how simulation should be used in the field of interventional cardiology.
{RESULTS}: This document provides a comprehensive review of the current state of simulation and how we as a society must formulate well validated studies to more closely examine and explore how this technology can be further studied and validated.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Simulation will likely take on a larger role in cardiovascular training and maintenance of certification, but at the current time lacks a large body of evidence for its use.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: Usability evaluation is now widely recognized as critical to the success of interactive health care applications. However, the broad range of usability inspection and testing methods available may make it difficult to decide on a usability assessment plan. To guide novices in the human-computer interaction field, we provide an overview of the methodological and empirical research available on the three usability inspection and testing methods most often used.
{METHODS}: We describe two 'expert-based' and one 'user-based' usability method: (1) the heuristic evaluation, (2) the cognitive walkthrough, and (3) the think aloud.
{RESULTS}: All three usability evaluation methods are applied in laboratory settings. Heuristic evaluation is a relatively efficient usability evaluation method with a high benefit-cost ratio, but requires high skills and usability experience of the evaluators to produce reliable results. The cognitive walkthrough is a more structured approach than the heuristic evaluation with a stronger focus on the learnability of a computer application. Major drawbacks of the cognitive walkthrough are the required level of detail of task and user background descriptions for an adequate application of the latest version of the technique. The think aloud is a very direct method to gain deep insight in the problems end users encounter in interaction with a system but data analyses is extensive and requires a high level of expertise both in the cognitive ergonomics and in computer system application domain.
{DISCUSSION} {AND} {CONCLUSIONS}: Each of the three usability evaluation methods has shown its usefulness, has its own advantages and disadvantages; no single method has revealed any significant results indicating that it is singularly effective in all circumstances. A combination of different techniques that compliment one another should preferably be used as their collective application will be more powerful than applied in isolation. Innovative mobile and automated solutions to support end-user testing have emerged making combined approaches of laboratory, field and remote usability evaluations of new health care applications more feasible.},

This article describes a comprehensive cognitive task analysis technique that can be used to simultaneously generate training requirements, performance metrics, scenario requirements, and simulator/simulation requirements for medical tasks. On the basis of a variety of existing techniques, we developed a scenario-based approach that asks experts to perform the targeted task multiple times, with each pass probing a different dimension of the training development process. In contrast to many cognitive task analysis approaches, we argue that our technique can be highly cost effective because it is designed to accomplish multiple goals. The technique was pilot tested with expert instructors from a large military medical training command. These instructors were employed to generate requirements for two selected combat casualty care tasks-cricothyroidotomy and hemorrhage control. Results indicated that the technique is feasible to use and generates usable data to inform simulation-based training system design.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: The aim of this study was to identify the critical decisions surgeons need to make regarding laparoscopic surgery, the information these decisions are based on, the strategies employed by surgeons to reach their objectives, and the difficulties experienced by novices.
{BACKGROUND}: Laparoscopic training focuses on the development of technical skills. However, successful surgical outcomes are also dependent on appropriate decisions made during surgery, which are influenced by critical cues and the use of appropriate strategies. Novices might not be as adept at cue detection and strategy use.
{METHOD}: Participants were eight attending surgeons. The authors employed task-analytic techniques to identify critical decisions inherent in laparoscopy and the cues, strategies, and novice traps associated with these decisions.
{RESULTS}: The authors used decision requirements tables to organize the data into the key decisions made during the preoperative, operative, and postoperative phases as well as the cues, strategies, and novice traps associated with these decisions. Key decisions identified for the preoperative phase included but were not limited to the decision of performing a laparoscopic versus open surgery, necessity to review the literature, practicing the procedure, and trocar placement. Some key decisions identified for the operative phase included converting to open surgery, performing angiograms, cutting tissue or organs, and reevaluation of the approach. Only one key decision was identified for the postoperative phrase: whether the surgeon's technique needs to be evaluated and revised.
{CONCLUSION}: The laparoscopic environment requires complex decision making, and novices are prone to errors in their decisions.
{APPLICATION}: The information elicited in this study is applicable to laparoscopic training.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: This study developed and validated a virtual reality ({VR}) simulator for use by interventional radiologists.
{BACKGROUND}: Research in the area of skill acquisition reports practice as essential to become a task expert. Studies on simulation show skills learned in {VR} can be successfully transferred to a real-world task. Recently, with improvements in technology, {VR} simulators have been developed to allow complex medical procedures to be practiced without risking the patient.
{METHOD}: Three studies are reported. In Study I, 35 consultant interventional radiologists took part in a cognitive task analysis to empirically establish the key competencies of the Seldinger procedure. In Study 2, 62 participants performed one simulated procedure, and their performance was compared by expertise. In Study 3, the transferability of simulator training to a real-world procedure was assessed with 14 trainees.
{RESULTS}: Study I produced 23 key competencies that were implemented as performance measures in the simulator. Study 2 showed the simulator had both face and construct validity, although some issues were identified. Study 3 showed the group that had undergone simulator training received significantly higher mean performance ratings on a subsequent patient procedure.
{CONCLUSION}: The findings of this study support the centrality of validation in the successful design of simulators and show the utility of simulators as a training device.
{APPLICATION}: The studies show the key elements of a validation program for a simulator. In addition to task analysis and face and construct validities, the authors highlight the importance of transfer of training in validation studies.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: Under the direction of the Association of Program Directors in Vascular Surgery, a survey was mailed to vascular surgery residents ({VSRs}), general surgery chief residents ({GS}-{CRs}), and fourth-year medical students ({MSs}) to better define reasons why trainees do and do not choose vascular surgery as a career.
{METHODS}: Questionnaires were mailed to all accredited {VSR} programs and their associated {GS} programs in the United States and Canada in 2001 (survey 1) and in 2003 (survey 2) and to 2 medical schools with {VSR} programs in 2001. A total of 197 {VSRs}, 169 {GS}-{CRs}, and 78 {MSs} responded (overall program response rate of 78\% for {VSRs}, 46\% for {GSRs}, 20\% for {MSs}). A scoring system was assigned, with 1.0 the least important and 5.0 the most important reasons to choose or not choose vascular surgery.
{RESULTS}: Technical aspects, role of mentors, and complex decision making involved in vascular surgery were the most important reasons that {VSRs}, {GS}-{CRs}, and {MSs} would choose vascular surgery as a specialty (average scores {\textgreater} or =4.0 for {VSRs} and {GS}-{CRs}; {\textgreater} or =3.5 for {MSs}). Responses of {GS}-{CRs} and {VSRs} did not vary significantly between surveys 1 and 2, except endovascular capabilities of vascular surgeons had a more important role in choosing vascular surgery, and future loss of patients to other interventionalists had a more important role in not choosing this specialty in the more recent survey of {GS}-{CRs} and {VSRs}. {MSs} identified lifestyle as a surgical resident (4.3) and as a surgeon (4.2) as the most important negative factors. A training paradigm consisting of 4 years general surgery + 2 years vascular surgery with a {GS} certificate was favored by 64\% of {GS}-{CRs} and 48\% of {VSRs}, compared with a paradigm of 5 years + 2 years with a general surgery certificate, which was favored by 29\% of {GS}-{CRs} and 25\% of {VSRs}, or 3 years + 3 years without a general surgery certificate, favored by 7\% of {GS}-{CRs} and 27\% of {VSRs}. Of note, 86\% of {MSs} favored 3 years general surgery + 3 years vascular surgery or 2 years general surgery + 4 years vascular surgery compared with longer general surgery training periods.
{CONCLUSION}: These findings may help vascular surgery program directors devise strategies to attract future trainees. The importance of mentorship to general surgery junior residents and medical students in choosing vascular surgery cannot be overestimated. Endovascular capabilities of vascular surgeons have an increasingly positive role in career choice by {GS}-{CRs} and {VSRs}, but these residents express increasing concerns about potential loss of patients to other specialists. Lifestyle concerns are the most important reasons why medical students do not choose vascular surgery as a career.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.jvs.2006.09.003},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Endovascular procedure simulators are now commercially available and in use for physician training. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of simulation-based training in vascular surgery residencies.
{METHODS}: Residents from vascular surgery programs in a five-state area were invited to participate in a series of 2-day endovascular training programs that used a high-fidelity endovascular procedure simulator ({SimSuite}; Medical Simulation Corporation, Denver, Colo), didactic instruction, computer-based training, and tabletop procedure demonstrations. The curriculum covered arteriography and intervention for treatment of aortoiliac, renal, and carotid artery disease. Nine residents participated, with one to three per training session. Each completed an average of 9.5 simulated endovascular cases. Performance on a standardized {TransAtlantic} Inter-Society Consensus B iliac angioplasty/stenting case was used to assess endovascular skills and knowledge at the beginning of the training program, and this was repeated at the completion of the training. Performance metrics were measured by the simulator, faculty observed trainees' performance of simulated cases, and trainees provided their evaluations of the usefulness of the simulation experiences.
{RESULTS}: Endovascular procedural skills on the standardized iliac intervention case improved after completion of the training program. Compared with performance early on day 1, performance improved (P {\textless} or = .05; paired t test): total procedure time decreased 54\%, volume of contrast decreased 44\%, and fluoroscopy time decreased 48\% (mean change from baseline). Selection of angioplasty balloon catheters and stents was improved, and the average number of catheters used and stents deployed decreased, although this did not reach statistical significance. Faculty observation allowed identification of shortcomings of knowledge and skills, including common problems with selection of catheter, balloon, and stent sizes; correct positioning of the sheath; and intraprocedural monitoring. Postcourse evaluations indicated support for the use of simulation in vascular surgery residents' endovascular training.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Training with a simulator, incorporated into an individual or small group learning session, offers a means to learn and realistically practice endovascular procedures without direct risk to patients, with measurable improvements in key performance metrics. How simulation training affects subsequent clinical performance has yet to be established.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Endovascular procedure volume has increased rapidly, and endovascular procedures have become the initial treatment option for many vascular diseases. Consequently, training in endovascular procedures has become an essential component of vascular surgery training. We hypothesized that, due to this paradigm shift, open surgical case volume may have declined, thereby jeopardizing training and technical skill acquisition in open procedures.
{METHODS}: Vascular surgery trainees are required to log both open and endovascular procedures with the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education ({ACGME}). We analyzed the {ACGME} database (2001-2007), which records all cases (by Current Procedural Terminology [{CPT}] code) performed by graduating vascular trainees. Case volume was evaluated according to the mean number of cases performed per graduating trainee.
{RESULTS}: The mean number of total major vascular procedures performed per trainee increased by 174\% between 2001 and 2007 (from 298.3 to 519.2). Endovascular diagnostic and therapeutic procedures increased by 422\% (from 63.7 to 269.1) and accounted for 93.0\% of the increase in total procedures. The number of open aortic procedures (aneurysm, occlusive, mesenteric, renal) decreased by 17.1\% (from 49.7 to 41.2), while the number of endovascular aortic aneurysm repair procedures increased by 298.8\% (from 16.9 to 50.5). Specifically, open aortic aneurysm procedures decreased by 21.8\%, aortobifemoral bypass increased by 3.2\%, and open mesenteric or renal procedures decreased by 13\%. Infrainguinal bypass procedures remained relatively constant (from 37.6 to 36.5, 2.9\% decrease), and the number of carotid endarterectomy procedures performed did not change significantly (from 43.6 to 42.2, 3.2\% decrease).
{CONCLUSION}: Vascular surgery trainees are performing a vastly increased total number of procedures. This increase in total procedure volume is almost entirely attributable to the recent increase in endovascular procedures. Aside from a small decline in open aortic procedures, the volume of open surgical procedures has largely remained stable. It is essential that vascular surgery training programs continue to focus on both endovascular and open surgical skills in order for vascular surgeons to remain the premier specialists to care for patients with vascular disease.},

	abstract = {Objective
Vascular surgery ({VS}) practice has expanded to incorporate interventional procedures, and this has stimulated changes in training. The purpose of this study was to review current {VS} training and certification in different countries.
Methods
A survey was completed by vascular surgeons involved with national certification in 34 countries. Results are expressed as the mean ± {SD}, with comparisons by χ2 and t tests.
Results
{VS} is currently an independent specialty in 15 surveyed countries, is a subspecialty of general surgery in 10 countries, and is not recognized as a specialty in nine countries. There has been a clear time trend toward independent certification. In countries with independent {VS} certification, the length of {VS} training is 3.7 ± 0.9 years plus 2.3 ± 0.7 years of associated core general surgery ({GS}), for a total training length of 5.9 ± 1.0 years. In countries with {VS} subspecialty certification, the length of {VS} training is 2.4 ± 0.5 years after 5.0 ± 1.1 years of {GS}, for a total training length of 7.4 ± 1.2 years (each P \&lt; .01 vs independent certification). The minimum required volume of major open {VS} operations during training is 151 ± 78 in countries with independent {VS} certification vs 113 ± 53 in countries with subspecialty certification. Endovascular requirements for training are established in 71\% of countries with independent certification vs 37\% of countries with subspecialty certification (P \&lt; .03). Countries with independent {VS} certification produce 5.4 ± 2.8 {VS} trainees per year per million population 65 years of age or older, vs 3.0 ± 1.8 in countries with subspecialty certification (P \&lt; .02).
Conclusions
Considerable variation exists in {VS} training in different countries. There is an international movement toward independent {VS} certification, with longer {VS} specific training but shorter overall residency duration. Counties with independent {VS} certification produce more trainees per year to serve their elderly population.},

	abstract = {Purpose
The education of surgical trainees should be based on an accurate evaluation of their surgical skill levels. In our hospital, the Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills ({OSATS}) is used for this purpose. We conducted this study to demonstrate the validity and accuracy of the {OSATS} for assessing surgical skills in the operating room ({OR}) setting.

Methods
Between January, 2007 and December, 2010, the {OSATS} global rating scale was used to assess several operations in which surgical trainees participated. We assessed ten surgical trainees who participated as the main surgeon or first assistant, and studied the correlation between their postgraduate year and their {OSATS} score.

Results
The median score of the global rating scale for each trainee improved with each year of experience. The median scores of all trainees in postgraduate years 3, 4, and 5 were significantly different (p {\textless} 0.001 for both the main surgeon and first assistant roles; Kruskal–Wallis test).

Conclusion
Using the {OSATS} global rating scale to assess the surgical skills of trainees in the {OR} was feasible and effective.},
